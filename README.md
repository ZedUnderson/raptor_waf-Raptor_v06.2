# to follow these commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CoolerVoid/raptor_waf

$ cd raptor_waf; make; bin/raptor
```

#Note:
Don't execute with "cd bin; ./raptor" use full path "bin/raptor" look detail https://github.com/CoolerVoid/raptor_waf/issues/4

Need lib pcre to compile.


# Example

Up some HTTPd server at port 80 
redirect with raptor to port 8883
```
$ bin/Raptor -h localhost -p 80 -r 8883 -w 4 -o loglog.txt
```

Copy vulnerable PHP code to your webserver directory
```
$ cp doc/test_dfa/test.php /var/www/html
```

Now you can test XSS attacks at 
http://localhost:8883/test.php

Other option to run(now with regex, look file config/regex_rules.txt to edit rules):
```
$ bin/Raptor -h 127.0.0.1 -p 80 -r 8883 -w 0 -o resultwaf -m pcre

```

Check sec test
